# EMT 156
## Description

The pulse-duration-modulation (PDM) which is used in the compressor EMT 156 is a new (mid 60´s) method in this field.  
It provides an elegant technical solution to the problem of controlling the compressor characteristics. The PDM  
compressor EMT 156 is therefore particularly adoptable to the varying demands in practical operation. It can  
according to requirements work as compressor, limiter or a combination of the two. The range of possible  
variations of its characteristics in the three above mentioned functions is shown in the diagrom 'static characteristics'.  
  
Furthermore, the recovery time can be made short, long or a function of the programme material. A further  
special feature of the PDM compressor is that it avoids the usual rise in background hiss during signal pauses
