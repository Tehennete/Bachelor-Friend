# FetCB
Forgotten Beast Alive!
[[Type de Compresseurs#FET (Field Effect Transistor)|FET]]
70s era FET Limiter/Compressor from UK!
Colorful and all around Limiter/Compressor for every source.
It was my first re-design while I build hardwares. But in digital version, I changed little bit. Just removed INPUT and added THRESHOLD. Normally, THRESHOLD is fixed and you can adjust compression level by driving INPUT.

Now, it's more versatile but still colorful!

**FEATURES**

- ATTACK: 20us to 200ms
- RELEASE: 25ms to 500ms
- THRESHOLD: +10dB to -30dB
- RATIO: 1:1 to 20:1
- MIX & OUTPUT
- External Sidechain

- ANALOG OBSESSION: This label is clickable. It will turn to red and engage Oversampling (4x)
