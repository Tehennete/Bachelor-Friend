# Anglais - TEDx Conference
Date [[2023-10-20]] - [[2023-10-24]]

[TEDx Mrs Pascal](https://youtu.be/Ge7c7otG2mk?si=NBel5LkTEYRDNjLg)
She used to train staff in Malaysia, to teach English. She talks about a man called Faisal that she *taught* a few years ago. His level of English is low but he's able to easily communicate in English because he knows some words but above all he's confident. So he doesn't care about being judged or making mistakes.
Her daughter is not a great piano player and didn't like the piano lessons because the focus was on how many mistakes she would make and not the fun part of it or just learning something. It has a negative impact on your self-image.
She went to a cybercafé because she had computers issues. He broke down. She didn't like the place because it was smelly, so she thought it was disgusting.  She noticed a boy who was playing a video game. He was shooting a lot of people in that game but he didn't kill a lot of people in the video game. He was terrible but was focused. He wasn't , shy and didn't have any sense of self-awareness. He is probably (self) confident and trying to get a result.
She went to a pharmacy to get her medicine (Omega). She talked to 2 people. The first one knew a lot about omega. Her level of English was pretty good but she was unable to help her because she as going in circles and didn't really answer her question. She was scared/anxious to talk to a native speaker and ended up showcasing what she knew in English. The second one was straightforward and went straight to the point even though she didn't have a lot of vocabulary. 
So language : **It's not an art to be mastered, it's a tool to use to get a result**



Self-awareness → la conscience de soi par rapport aux autres.
Yet to be determined → à définir
Confidence
Not focusing just on the mistakes 
Being concentrated on getting a result 
To go straight to the point → Aller droit au but
Relate → to have a connection 
To slang words = argot
