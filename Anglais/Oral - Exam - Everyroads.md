- Meditation about **solitude, escaping** with a **mental palace**

- **inner monologues** of the 5 members : description **of ideal vision of a retreat place** far from the real world

- beautiful view, close to the stars, fench garden..

- Palace becomes a **place of contraste**, light and dark, Clarity doubt, Tranquility and screaming

- The song ends with a **questioning** of this illusion of perfection, and an **awareness** of the **fragility** of existence

## Lyrics 

It's probably just a small place  
With a lot of land around it, on a hill  
French garden on the outside, probably big  
Entrance with a gate  
Must be a place of solitude, a mental solitude  
It's an attitude, that I know very well  
But, a physical place?

Only have one little staircase  
And the typical fountain in the entrance  
Garden extends around the house  
But keep it simple, maybe another fountain on the other side  
Something a bit bigger, but not necessarily huge  
Yeah, like a low fence with a little gate that's never closed  
What a great view  
Enjoy the tranquility  
In the alley for the cypresses that leads to the house  
And then just this vast sort of, uh, horizon  
Gather my senses together in the woods, experience hope

I keep a dungeon for the darker thoughts  
To cleanse myself, to be able to go downstairs and scream  
I think if there's a s-, if there's a palace in my mind  
It's, it's less sort of a fortress away from the rest of the world  
It's halfway between the world and the stars  
The sounds for the colors, for the possibilities of perception  
Absolute clarity, I know the answers  
You can just get away from everything  
Except for your own thoughts  
Grounded in that entity  
I don't think I would feel alone, because it doesn't really matter  
You have the best view you could possibly imagine  
I think you can see the stars a lot better up there  
You can bend them everywhere  
Somewhere near the event horizon of solitude  
(Absolute tranquility)  
Over the end of every road

All of the ghosts, people you love  
Even your friends don't want to know  
But you can depend on every note  
Over the end of every road

But that's a lie  
You actually believe that you have the formula, uh  
And then you see that it is wrong  
Afraid I might become a stranger  
And you'd just be trapped with yourself  
Everything falls apart
