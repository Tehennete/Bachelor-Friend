## Devoir anglais scène arène

### Description

Scene : boxing match. In this scene, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) predicts the pattern
that his boxing match will take in his mind.
(Consequences Uncertainty Time = suspended)


### Time study
We are going to study how the sound gets us to get lost in time and how it allows us to penetrate into Sherlock’s mind.

**0:21** : this shot shows a girl. We will see how this girl is initiating the strategy of Sherlock’s fight (handkerchief).
Sounds (of the crowd for exemple) are pitched down and slowed AND the voice over appears here to get the viewer into Sherlock’s mind.

Then, while Sherlock explains to the viewer his plan, sounds alternate between slowed down and sped up to their reel, actual speed, to show his cleverness and his ability to quickly plan actions that will lead him to achieve his goals.
We can see that sounds are chosen carefully and linked to the action. 

Example: **00:35** → we can hear an acute and deaf sound that illustrates Sherlock hitting his opponent right in the ears. This way, the viewer shares the feeling of dizziness by being as destabilised as the fighter.

This scene of combat makes us alternate empathy (sharing the feeling of the characters, we can almost feel the punches and share the pain).
We also have multiple layers of sounds to give character to the hits the fighter receives.
#### Example :
**0:55** → 2 sounds spaced = huge pain of jaw dislocating entirely.
**0:56** : At the same time, we have low-pitched sounds (sped up and not sped up) that define the movements of the fighters.

**0:57** → **01:11** : this part of the scene (as all others) contains sounds that break the silence to catch the viewer’s attention.

**01:17** : the crowd’s noise becomes loud again and the voice over stops to make the viewer understand that we come back to reality (we get out of Sherlock’s mind) and that action is gonna follow up.

**01:22** : we can hear a single voice encouraging the fighters → emphasizes the fact that the action is gonna happen.

**01:30** : the actual fight begins. The same sounds as when we were in Sherlock’s mind are used but they are not pitched, distorted and slowed anymore => real action and spontaneity of a fight
However a lot emphasized (i.e. handkerchief sound) to make the viewer still be empathic when the fighters get hit.

**01:41** : crowd noises stop => they are impressed and stunned by what they saw, unlike the viewer who saw it coming. From that point only body noises can be heard (no dialogues or voice over anymore).

**02:09** : music (banjo) comes in to show that the action ends and shows how Sherlock’s intelligence always wins.

This scene shows how Sherlock always counts on himself to get out of the bad situations (he puts himself in) using his extraordinary intelligence. + confidence and nonchalance

**03:33** The music is getting louder again, it's the same theme we heard at the beginning of the scene. This way, the viewer gets out of time and space within this scene. The scene is a parenthesis in

### Quotes
